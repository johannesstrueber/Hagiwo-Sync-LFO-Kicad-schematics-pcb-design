# HAGIWO's SYNC LFO Eurorack Module<br/> Work in Progress Schematics, PCBs, and Design Files 

In this repository, I digitalized HAGIWOs sketched schematics in Kicad and then created PCBs for the circuit and a front panel. I also created two design files. The first is for matching the drill holes of the panel with the placed components. The second is for labeling the components on the silkscreen layer of the panel.

***This is a work-in-progress project. Actually, this is my first layout. Take nothing for granted. The second revision is produced.*** 
<br/>
<br/>
**TODO** <br/>
<ul>
<li>Physical solution for wrong pot direction (currently software solution)</li>
<li>code for second inverted output (is in WIP status)</li>
<li>GND planes</li>
</ul>
<br/>

**Here are the in- and outputs. To get a idea of the module**
- Knob 1: AMP – amplifier control. The output voltage is set between 0 and 5 volts. 
- Knob 2: PHASE – phase control sets the phase
- Knob 3: waveform control 
- Knob 4: MOD – internal modulation, creates complex waveforms 
- Input 1:  CLK – clock in
- Output 1: OUT – output
- Output 2: INV – inverted output
<br/>

**KICAD Notes**
 - design_placement.svg is placed on layer USER 8
 - circuit layout is generated by the freerouting plugin

**CHANGELOG** <br/>
<br/>

**rev 0.2.1** <br/>
<ul>
<li>I adjusted the drilling diameter to 7.2mm to fit the threads of some potentiometers, e.g., t18. The previous front panel was made for rv09 potentiometers, which don't have a larger thread drilling.</li>
<li>the main pcb stays the same as 0.2.0</li>
</ul>
<br/>

**rev 0.2** <br/>
<ul>
<li> !!! changed pin order on connector </li>
<li> 10 pin connector instead of 16 pin</li>
<li> add missing 33k resistor for LED </li>
<li> resistors and capacitors now have values </li>
<li> larger gap setting for disc capacitors </li>
<li> code wrong direction potis</li>
<li> new design to match other upcoming modules </li>
<li> second output INV - inverted 
</ul>
<br/>

**rev 0.1** <br/>
<ul>
<li>first layout PRODUCED and working</li>
</ul>
<br/>

Hence, this is only trying to put HAGIWOs circuit into Kicad to create a PCB. You can find more information about the layout and functionality [ + here](https://note.com/solder_state/n/n4c600f2431c3)
